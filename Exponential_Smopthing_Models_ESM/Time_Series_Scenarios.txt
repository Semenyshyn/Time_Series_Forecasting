Time Series Scenarios
Next we're going to be exploring several different exponential models to understand
how each model is different and which model should be used for which specific
scenario you'll see in a time series.
The possible time series (TS) scenarios can be recognized by asking the following
questions:

TS has a trend?
If yes, is the trend increasing linearly or exponentially?

TS has seasonality?
If yes, do the seasonal components increase in magnitude over time?
Scenarios

Therefore the scenarios could be:
        No-Trend, No-Seasonal - (Simple Exponential Smoothing Method)
        No-Trend, Seasonal-Constant
        No-Trend, Seasonal-Increasing
        Trend-Linear,No-Seasonal
        Trend-Linear,Seasonal-Constant
        Trend-Linear,Seasonal-Increasing
        Trend-Exponential,No-Seasonal
        Trend-Exponential,Seasonal-Constant
        Trend-Exponential,Seasonal-Increasing

As you can see there are nine possible scenarios.

ETS Models
We are going to explore four ETS models that can help forecast
these possible time-series scenarios.

Holt's Linear Trend Method

Holt-Winters Seasonal Method
